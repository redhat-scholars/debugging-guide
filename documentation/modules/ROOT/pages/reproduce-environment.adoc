_15 MINUTE PRACTICE_

Using **Argo CD**, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, you will be able to reproduce easily the environment of the **Mysterious Apps**.

== What is Argo CD?

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[Argo CD^] is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

It follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining 
the desired application state. 

It automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application 
deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.

== Log in to Argo CD

`*Click on the 'Developer GitOps' button below*`

[link={GITOPS_URL}]
[role='params-link']
[window="_blank"]
image::developer-gitops-button.png[Developer GitOps - Button, 300]

Then `*log in as user{USER_ID}/{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}*`. Once completed, you will be redirected to the following page.

== Sync/Deploy The GitOps Application

From the **Application menu**,`*click on your 'staging-project{USER_ID}' application*`

image::argocd-application.png[Argo CD - Application, 500]

The application status is initially in yellow **OutOfSync** state since the application has yet to be 
deployed into staging-project{USER_ID} OpenShift project, and no Kubernetes resources have been created.

image::argocd-outofsync-details.png[Argo CD - OutOfSync Application, 900]

Now let's deploy the Coolstore Application into **staging-project{USER_ID}**.

`*Click on 'Sync > Synchronize'*`.

image::argocd-sync.png[Argo CD - Sync Application, 900]

This task retrieves the manifests from the GitOps Repository and performs _kubectl apply_ command of 
the manifests. Your application is now running. You can now view its resource components,
logs, events, and assessed health status.

You should see everything in green.

== Controlling Ingress Traffic
The Application deployed is using **Istio** (_covered in the next lab_). To be able to access the application from outside of the cluster we have to expose a specific service reachable externally, this service is called **Istio Gateway**. A Gateway allows Istio features such as monitoring and route rules to be applied to traffic entering the cluster. 

NOTE: To open a '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Open Terminal in specific container' ->  'workshop-tools'*`

Create the Istio **Gateway** and its **VirtualService** `*by executing the following commands in the '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply --namespace=staging-project{USER_ID} -f -
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: istio-gateway{USER_ID}
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use Istio default gateway implementation
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:
        - "gateway-staging-project{USER_ID}.{APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX}"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: gateway
spec:
  hosts:
    - "gateway-staging-project{USER_ID}.{APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX}"
  gateways:
    - istio-gateway{USER_ID}
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            port:
              number: 8080
            host: gateway
EOF
----

Then use the new **OpenShift Route** in the Web Service `*by executing the following commands in the '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
oc set env deployment/web COOLSTORE_GW_ENDPOINT=http://gateway-staging-project{USER_ID}.{APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX} -n staging-project{USER_ID}
----

== Testing the application

In the link:{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
select the `**staging-project{USER_ID}**` to be taken to the project overview page.


image::openshift-app-deployed-by-argocd.png[OpenShift - Coolstore Project Deployed by Argo CD , 700]

You can see that all resources of your application have been created by Argo CD. 

Then, `*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Web Service*`.

Your browser will be redirect to **your Web Service running on OpenShift**.
You should be able to see the CoolStore application with all products and their inventory status.

Now, you are now ready to tackle all the problem**S**!
